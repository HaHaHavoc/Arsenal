there's pictures to explain (hopefully everything).

material is

210 degree nozzle

please look at all pictures first before building and starting to build.
 the grip is not included (can be found on Mussys thingiverse)
and the other half of the brace is not included (other half can be found at AWCY?)

 and raise your voice if you need help. goodluck and f*ck the AFT
